When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You'd want to use a remote repository when you are sharing your files with other people,
who are working on the project. Also it would allow you to access the project,
while not on your current computer too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to check to make sure there are no conflicts? Make sure that you are not overwriting files or any drastic changes have been made?
